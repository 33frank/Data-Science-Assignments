### Reading Assignments (Due Wednesday Sept 2 at 5:30pm)

- *Think ‘process’ not ‘product’. The goal is to learn. The goal is not to hand in a perfect assignment.*

- *Skim your homework assignment BEFORE you do the readings. It will help focus your attention!*

- *SQR3: Scan, Question, Read, Recall, Review!!!!*

1. Loops
    - In DataCamp, go to Intermediate Python, Chapter 4: Loops (Click [here](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python/loops?ex=1) to start)
    - Complete "While Loop" through "Loop over list of lists"
 
2. Functions
    - Read this [introduction to functions.](http://introtopython.org/introducing_functions.html) (Don't worry about the exercises)
    - OPTIONAL: Read more on functions [here.](https://365datascience.com/python-functions/)

3. Classes
    - Working with classes can be challenging. Focus your attention on:
        1. Creating classes.
        2. Adding attributes. 
        3. Creating class methods. (methods that operate on the entire class)
        4. Creating instance methods. (methods that act only on the instance)
        5. Creating objects from classes. (`foo = MyClass(attr1, attr2`)
    - Focus less (but be aware) of:
        1. Inheritance

    - Read this [introduction to classes.](http://introtopython.org/classes.html) (Don't worry about the exercises or any notes about Python 2.7.)
    - Read [this](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects) and complete the exercise at the end.
    - Read this [Python's Methods Demystified](https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/)
4. Complete the `week_02_homework.ipynb`.
