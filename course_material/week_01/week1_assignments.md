 - A great quick reference.

### In Class Assignment:
1. Finish any installs not completed in class. 
2. Skim the `Survival Guide` presentation. We will discuss this in more detail throughout first 8 wks.
3. Create a complete schedule for yourself and include EVERYTHING you can (Work, commute, dinner, any obligations and study time). Highlight times you will be studying. 
    - Head over to this [spreadsheet](https://onedrive.live.com/Edit.aspx?resid=389B7AA93FE24CC9!1718&wdSkeletonState=%7B%22IsEnabled%22:true,%22Options%22:32%7D&wde=xlsx&wdp=0&wdorigin=SDX.Skydrive*Root&wdhostclicktime=1597795612486&wdredirectionreason=Force_SingleStepBoot&wdrcid=7486c348-b053-40bb-9306-dd93bce911d9&wdrldc=1&authkey=!AHS0TvSejeITUjc) and see the example schedule on the first tab. 
    - Create a tab with `your initials`.
    - Copy the `template` sheet into your tab. 
    - Fill out an accurate schedule for yourself. 
        - This does not need to be updated as your schedule changes. 

### Reading Assignments

*Think ‘process’ not ‘product’. The goal is to learn. The goal is not to hand in a perfect assignment.*

*Skim your homework assignment BEFORE you do the readings. It will help focus your attention!*

*SQR3: Scan, Question, Read, Recall, Review!!!!*

1. [Hello World](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello,_World!)
2. [Data Structures](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/data-structures-python) 
3. [String Manipulation](https://www.thelearningpoint.net/computer-science/learning-python-programming-and-data-structures/learning-python-programming-and-data-structures--tutorial-12--string-manipulation)
4. Go through the Provided `python_click_through.ipynb`.  

    - Open another notebook and copy each cell and play with it in the new notebook. 

    - Ask yourself a question and experiment. 

        - What if I change this variable? 

            - What’s the outcome? 

        - What if I intentionally write code I think will fail? 

            - Does it fail? 

        - What if I combine the concept in the cell above with this cell?
