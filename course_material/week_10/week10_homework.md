## Homework due Wednesday, October 28, 2020
* __Keep working on the in-class notebooks,__ they are not due until Wednesday the 28th with the rest of your homework.

* __Complete the Linear Algebra Review__ module of Standford University's Machine Learning Coursera by Andrew Ng
    * Sign up for Coursera, if you don't have an account
    * Go to landing page of course and click Enroll, then select the No Certificate/Free option
        * https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
    * The Linear Algebra Review is the last module in Week 1. It might look locked from the initial page, but it's not. Go to the Week 1 page below and scroll down to get to the Linear Algebra Review section. 
        * https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/1
        * Use this [direct link to first video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/1) if you have issues
    * Watch the videos and take the quizzes in the videos
    * The readings have some errors in my browser where the new line between consecutive rows in vectors and matrices has been converted to a space (e.g. a 2x3 matrix is rendered incorrectly as [a b cd e f]). This is hard to look at, so build intuition and notes through the videos, and then use the programming applets to confirm your intuition. 

* __Review the concept of a derivative__ from Calculus
    * Watch [The paradox of the derivative | Essence of calculus, chapter 2](https://youtu.be/9vKqVkMQHKk) from 3Blue1Brown
    * If you hated that, try [this shorter video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-differentiation-1-new/ab-2-1/v/derivative-as-a-concept) from Khan Academy
