## Deep Learning Specialization
* For those of you interested in learning more in-depth material about Neural Networks, we highly recommend you to complete the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). This is a 5 course series from Coursera which deals with implementing a set of state-of-the-art Neural Networks. This is well beyond the scope of CoderGirl- Data Science, but we wanted to keep this here as a reference.

# Week 22
## Mini-Project: Homework due Wednesday, Feb 3, 2020 @ 5:30pm
* Perform Explortatory Data Analysis (EDA) on [Heart Disease Kaggle Project](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
* Post the link to your GitHub repo for Mini-Project part I: EDA
    - Your notebook should address each of the following:
        - Data issues: missing values, duplicate values, outliers
        - Data cleaning solutions: imputation/estimation, dropping entries -- justify your choices!
        - Describe the realtionship of features to your target (should include at least a few plots). 
        - Feature engineering (transformation, normalization, createing new combinations of features, etc), if you think this is necessary. Describe your rationale.

# Week 23
## Mini-Project: Homework due Wednesday, Feb 10, 2020 @ 5:30pm
* Post the link to your GitHub repo for Mini-Project part II: Modeling
    - Your modeling notebook should include each of the following:
        - (Feature engineering, if not captured in the EDA notebook. Sometimes it is easier or makes more sense to do feature engineering in the same notebook as your model.)
        - Splitting data into train/test sets
        - Build (at least one) model
        - Predict test set using model(s)
        - A quantiative metric of model(s) performance
