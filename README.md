### Homework tips
*Think ‘process’ not ‘product’. The goal is to learn. The goal is not to hand in a perfect assignment.*

*Skim your homework assignment BEFORE you do the readings. It will help focus your attention!*

*SQR3: Scan, Question, Read, Recall, Review!!!!*

# Week 1 - Introductions and Python
## In Class Assignment due Friday, Aug 21, 2020 @ 8pm
1. Finish any installs not completed in class. 
2. Skim the `Survival Guide` presentation. We will discuss this in more detail throughout first 8 wks.
3. Create a complete schedule for yourself and include EVERYTHING you can (Work, commute, dinner, any obligations and study time). Highlight times you will be studying. 
    - Head over to this [spreadsheet](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AslM4j-peps4jTba0I4xcgllBZH7?e=LqiTV8) and see the example schedule on the first tab. 
    - Create a tab with `your initials`.
    - Copy the `template` sheet into your tab. 
    - Fill out an accurate schedule for yourself. 
        - This does not need to be updated as your schedule changes.

        - Describe the realtionship of features to your target (should include at least a few plots).
