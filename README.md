# Week 3
## Homework due Wednesday Feb 6, 2019 @ 6pm
* Readings
    - [Loops](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/loops-python-tutorial)
    - [Functions](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/functions-python-tutorial)
    - [Modulo documentation](https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/operators/modulus.html)
        - Supplemental: You'll need to use the *modulo* operator for one of your homeworks. If the documentation below isn't enough to help you solve the challenge, see the video as well.
        - [Modulo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ythAmIKawv0)
    - [List comprehensions](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-list-comprehension)
        - Supplemental (not required): [more on list comprehensions](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_list_comprehension.php)
    - [Lambda functions & map, filter, reduce](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_lambda.php)
    
* Cheat Sheets
    - [Jupyter notebooks](https://datacamp-community-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/48093c40-5303-45f4-bbf9-0c96c0133c40)
    - [Python for Data Science](https://datacamp-community-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/e30fbcd9-f595-4a9f-803d-05ca5bf84612)
        
* Hackerrank Python
    - [Loops](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-loops/problem)
    - [List comprehensions](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/list-comprehensions/problem)
        - The Problem statement and Tutorial should be sufficient to guide you through this exercise, but the example code using list comprehensions on the Problem page is difficult to read. Here it is line by line (and in Python3):
        __Code using list comprehensions:__  
        `x = int( raw_input() )`  
        `y = int( raw_input() )`  
        `n = int( raw_input() )`  
        `print( [ [i, j] for i in range(x + 1) for j in range(y + 1) if( ( i + j ) != n )] )`  
    - [Your first Python function](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/whats-your-name/problem)
        - Bonus: Try testing your code against custom input (your name!).
    - [More functions](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/write-a-function/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen)
    - Bonus: [Nested lists](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/nested-list/problem)
